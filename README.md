# Filepicker.io and Zenc

Sample integration between [Filepicker.io](http://www.filepicker.io) and [Zencoder](http://www.zencoder.com). Ready to deploy on Heroku. There's an integration-only API key already included to use with `basic.html`, so you can start using this right away.

## Setup

  $ npm install
  $ node app.js
